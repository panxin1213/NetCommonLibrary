This file describes what folder contains the assemblies you need to use with a particular version of the .NET Framework.



Folder						Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

net2.0						Contains assemblies to use with .NET Framework 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5.1 and Mono.
						This is the assemblies that you should normally use.
						Note that this assembly cannot be used when targeting the .NET Framework 3.5 
						or 4.0 Client Profile as it depends on System.Web. In such an envionment use 
						the library under net3.5_ClientProfile instead.


net2.0_AuthenticodeSigned			Same as above, but the assemblies are digitally signed with Authenticode. 
						Signed assemblies may load slower than without Authenticode.


net3.5_ClientProfile				Contains assemblies to use with .NET Framework 3.5 or 4.0 Client Profile.
						Note that this assembly excludes the Save overload accepting an HttpResponse
						object. This is by design as the client profile excludes System.Web assembly.



net3.5_ClientProfile_AuthenticodeSigned		Same as above, but the assemblies are digitally signed with Authenticode. 
						Signed assemblies may load slower than without Authenticode.
